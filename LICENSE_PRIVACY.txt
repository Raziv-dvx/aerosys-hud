## Information We Collect

### System Information (Local Only)
The Application collects the following system information **locally on your device**:

**Hardware Metrics:**

- Memory (RAM) usage, channels, and specifications
- GPU usage, temperature, clock speeds, and VRAM
- Storage/disk usage, health (SMART), and I/O statistics
- Network adapter information and usage statistics

**System Information:**
- Operating system details and version
- Active window titles (for monitoring purposes)
- Audio output volume levels
- Screen brightness levels
- System uptime and health scores

### Data Storage and Privacy

**IMPORTANT - All Data is Local:**
- ✅ **100% Local Storage** - All collected data stays on YOUR device

### Network Requests

The Application makes **minimal** network requests:

1. **Public IP Detection** (Optional)
   - Uses ipify.org API to display your public IP address
   - Only your IP address is sent to ipify.org
   - No personal or system data is transmitted

2. **Ping Tests** (Optional)
   - Sends ping requests to your gateway and Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
   - Used only to measure network latency
   - No data is transmitted beyond the ping packet

**You can disable network features** if you prefer complete offline operation.

## How We Use Information

The Application uses collected system information **solely** to:
- Display real-time system performance metrics in the dashboard
- Track historical usage patterns (stored locally only)
- Provide system health monitoring and performance insights
- Calculate load averages and usage statistics
- Optimize application performance

**We do NOT:**
- Send data to external servers (except optional IP detection)
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Share data with third parties
- Track your behavior or usage patterns remotely
- Collect personally identifiable information (PII)

## Data Retention

- **Network Usage Statistics:** Daily and monthly totals stored locally in application settings
- **Historical Data:** Load averages and usage history retained in memory during runtime
- **Persistent Storage:** Minimal settings stored in local configuration files
- **Data Deletion:** All data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the application

**To manually clear stored data:**
1. Close the application
2. Delete the application's configuration folder (location varies by OS)
3. Or simply uninstall the application

## Third-Party Services

The Application uses **only one** third-party service:

**ipify.org** - Public IP Address Detection
- Purpose: Display your public IP address in the Network tab

- No encryption is applied to local data (it's on your device)
- Standard file system permissions protect stored data

**Network Security:**
- HTTPS is used for all external API requests (ipify.org)
